<h2>My Love 💌</h2>

<p id="loveText">

We’ve been talking for more than three months now, and honestly, my heart fell for you a long time ago. I just didn’t realize it at first. But lately, I’ve understood that I can’t hold it back anymore.

Every moment with you reminds me that it’s okay to love, even when there’s a risk of getting hurt. Because love is beautiful. And I’m still one of those people who believe in fairytales — that one day, I’ll find my Boaz, become someone’s Ruth and experiment 1Conrithians13:4-8.

It took me time to truly notice your way of showing love and interest. But the day I understood, I let my guard down. For me, it felt like love at first sight. I was scared, of course. Scared of falling for someone who might hurt me again. But today, I’m so grateful that I texted you that day.

Sometimes, I genuinely feel so lonely and I deeply miss you even if we've never met. It feels like the world keeps trying to keep us apart. And honestly, I’m tired of waiting to see you. I'd love being close to you, feeling your presence next to me, laying in your arms, resting on your chest, and kissing your lips.

I love you so much that I feel uneasy when you’re busy… and unbelievably happy the moment your name appears on my screen. I know how risky this sounds. I know how vulnerable it makes me. But you’re a risk I’m willing to take.

</p>
<p>From the deepest feelings of my heart,</p>
<p>To my dearest love,</p>
<p>Yvette 💕</p>
